**MongoDB Insert Operations with Python**
This repository demonstrates **how to perform insert operations on a MongoDB database using Python and the PyMongo driver.** It provides a comprehensive guide for developers looking to understand and implement various insert methods in MongoDB with Python.
**Key Features:**
MongoDB Connection: Establishes a connection to a local MongoDB instance using PyMongo.
Insert Operations: Detailed examples of different insert methods including insert_one() and insert_many().
Error Handling: Demonstrates how to handle common errors during insert operations.
**Technologies Used:**
Python 3.6+
PyMongo driver
MongoDB (local instance)
Code Structure:
**Setup and Connection:**
Imports the necessary modules from PyMongo.
Initializes a client connection to the local MongoDB server.
Connects to a specific database and collection.
**Insert Operations:**
insert_one(): Demonstrates how to insert a single document into a collection.
insert_many(): Shows how to insert multiple documents at once.
**Result Handling:**
Explains how to check if insert operations were acknowledged.
Shows how to retrieve inserted document IDs.
**Error Handling:**
Provides examples of handling DuplicateKeyError for insert_one().
Demonstrates handling BulkWriteError for insert_many().
**Usage:**
Each insert operation is clearly commented and can be run independently. Users can modify the document structures and error handling to fit their specific use cases.
Important Notes:
The code assumes a local MongoDB instance running on the default port (27017).
The insert() method is mentioned as deprecated and should not be used in applications.
When storing results of insert operations, use different variable names to avoid "Duplicate Error".
The repository includes examples of proper error handling for both insert_one() and insert_many() operations.
Best Practices Highlighted:
Using insert_one() for single document insertions and insert_many() for multiple documents.
Checking the acknowledged status and inserted_id(s) after insert operations.
Implementing try-except blocks for error handling, specifically for DuplicateKeyError and BulkWriteError.
Potential Extensions:
Implement more complex document structures for insertions.
Add examples of inserting documents with custom _id fields.
Demonstrate how to perform insert operations with different write concerns.
